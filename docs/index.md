# OpenShift Demo Lab

Welcome to the comprehensive OpenShift Demo Lab! This hands-on learning platform is designed to take you through the essential concepts of container orchestration, from basic containerization to production-ready deployments.

## üéØ What You'll Learn

This lab provides practical experience with:

- **Container Fundamentals** - Understanding containerization and basic deployment patterns
- **Storage Management** - Ephemeral vs persistent storage in containerized environments  
- **Resource Management** - CPU and memory limits, horizontal autoscaling
- **Health Monitoring** - Application lifecycle management and health probes
- **Production Deployment** - Real-world OpenShift deployment patterns

## üöÄ Lab Progression

The lab follows a progressive approach with increasingly sophisticated concepts:

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   :material-database-off:{ .lg .middle } **Demo App V1**

    ---

    Learn about **ephemeral storage** limitations and basic container deployment patterns.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Start with V1](demo-apps/v1-ephemeral.md)

-   :material-database:{ .lg .middle } **Demo App V2**

    ---

    Implement **persistent storage** with database backends and production deployment patterns.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Continue to V2](demo-apps/v2-persistent.md)

-   :material-chart-line:{ .lg .middle } **Demo App V3**

    ---

    Master **resource management** and horizontal pod autoscaling with CLI operations.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Progress to V3](demo-apps/v3-resources.md)

-   :material-heart-pulse:{ .lg .middle } **Demo App V4**

    ---

    Complete the journey with **health probe** configuration and production readiness.

## üìã Prerequisites

Before starting the lab, ensure you have:

- ‚úÖ IBM Cloud account with appropriate permissions
- ‚úÖ Group assignment and VPC resources (provided during lab setup)
- ‚úÖ Basic familiarity with containers and Kubernetes concepts
- ‚úÖ OpenShift CLI (`oc`) installed (optional if you want to run commands locally vs Cloud Shell) 

!!! tip "Don't have the ibmcloud cli, kubectl or oc installed? "
    Don't worry you can use [Cloud Shell](https://cloud.ibm.com/shell) which includes all the tools you need for the lab

## üéì Learning Outcomes

By the end of this lab, you'll have hands-on experience with:

### Container Fundamentals
- Understanding container lifecycle management
- Configuring resource requests and limits
- Managing environment variables and configuration
- Working with multi-stage Docker builds

### Storage and Persistence
- Recognizing ephemeral storage limitations
- Implementing Persistent Volume Claims (PVC)
- Integrating database backends
- Understanding StatefulSet vs Deployment patterns

### Networking and Services
- Service discovery and internal DNS
- Route configuration with TLS termination
- Load balancing across multiple pods
- Health check integration

### Scaling and Performance
- Manual scaling operations
- Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) configuration
- Resource utilization monitoring
- Load testing and traffic generation

### Production Readiness
- Health probe configuration (liveness, readiness, startup)
- Rolling deployment strategies
- Application lifecycle management
- Monitoring and troubleshooting techniques
