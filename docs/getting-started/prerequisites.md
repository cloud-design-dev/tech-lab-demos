# Prerequisites

Before beginning the OpenShift Demo Lab, ensure you have the necessary access, tools, and knowledge to complete the exercises successfully.

## üîê Required Access

### IBM Cloud Account
- ‚úÖ **IBM Cloud account** with appropriate permissions
- ‚úÖ **Access to create ROKS clusters** in the assigned VPC
- ‚úÖ **Resource group access** (typically "Default")
- ‚úÖ **Container Registry permissions** for the lab COS instance

### Lab Resources
- ‚úÖ **Pre-provisioned VPC infrastructure** (provided by lab instructors)
- ‚úÖ **Subnet allocations** for your assigned group
- ‚úÖ **Secrets Manager instance** for certificate management
- ‚úÖ **Container Object Storage** for internal registry

!!! info "Resource Provisioning"
    Lab instructors have pre-provisioned the VPC infrastructure, subnets, and supporting services. You'll use these during cluster creation.

## üõ†Ô∏è Required Tools

### Essential Tools

#### Recommended approach

It is recommended to use [IBM Cloud Shell](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-shell?topic=cloud-shell-shell-ui) for the lab exercises, as it comes pre-installed with necessary tools like `kubectl`, `ibmcloud` and `oc` as well as ibmcloud cli plugins for container service and container registry.

To open Cloud Shell, click the IBM Cloud Shell icon in the IBM Cloud console. A session starts and automatically logs you in to the IBM Cloud CLI with your current account.

#### Alternative

If you prefer to work from your local machine, ensure you have the following tools installed:

| Tool | Purpose | Installation |
|------|---------|-------------|
| **OpenShift CLI (`oc`)** | Command-line operations | [Download from Red Hat](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/cli_reference/openshift_cli/getting-started-cli.html) |
| **IBM Cloud CLI** | Manage IBM Cloud resources | [Installation Guide](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli?topic=cli-install-ibmcloud-cli) |
| **git** | Clone demo repositories | Local development |

#### Optional Tools

| Tool | Purpose | When You'll Need It |
|------|---------|-------------------|
| **kubectl** | Kubernetes-native operations | Advanced troubleshooting |
| **curl** | API testing and debugging | API exploration |
| **Docker** | Local container testing | Local development |
