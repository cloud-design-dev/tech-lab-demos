# Lab Overview

Welcome to the OpenShift Demo Lab! This comprehensive hands-on learning experience is designed to take you from basic container concepts to production-ready OpenShift deployments.

## üéØ What You'll Accomplish

By the end of this lab, you'll have deployed and managed multiple applications demonstrating key OpenShift and Kubernetes concepts:

- **Containerized Applications** running on enterprise Kubernetes
- **Persistent Storage** solutions for stateful applications
- **Resource Management** with CPU and memory limits
- **Horizontal Scaling** with automatic pod autoscaling
- **Health Monitoring** with probes and self-healing capabilities

## üèóÔ∏è Lab Architecture

The lab environment consists of:

### Infrastructure Layer
- **IBM Cloud VPC** - Virtual Private Cloud for network isolation
- **Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud (ROKS)** - Managed Kubernetes platform
- **IBM Cloud Block Storage** - Persistent storage for databases
- **IBM Secrets Manager** - Certificate and secret management

### Application Layer
- **Demo Applications V1-V4** - Progressive learning applications
- **PostgreSQL Databases** - Persistent data storage

## üìö Learning Path

The lab follows a carefully structured progression:

### Phase 1: Foundation (Steps 1-2)
- **Deploy ROKS Cluster** - Understand OpenShift architecture
- **Explore Console** - Master the OpenShift web interface

### Phase 2: Basic Applications (Step 3)
- **Demo App V1** - Learn ephemeral storage limitations
- **Containerization** - Understand S2I builds and deployments

### Phase 3: Persistent Storage (Step 4)
- **Demo App V2** - Implement database persistence
- **Data Survival** - See how persistent storage solves real problems

### Phase 4: Production Concepts (Steps 5-6)
- **Demo App V3** - Master resource limits and autoscaling
- **Demo App V4** - Implement health probes and monitoring

## üéì Key Learning Concepts

- **Pod Lifecycle Management** - How containers start, run, and restart
- **Service Discovery** - How applications find and communicate with each other
- **Load Balancing** - How traffic is distributed across multiple pods
- **Rolling Deployments** - How to update applications without downtime

### Storage Management
- **Ephemeral vs Persistent** - Understanding different storage types
- **Volume Mounts** - How containers access external storage
- **Database Integration** - Connecting applications to persistent data stores
- **Backup and Recovery** - Protecting critical application data

### Resource Management
- **CPU and Memory Limits** - Preventing applications from consuming too many resources
- **Horizontal Pod Autoscaling** - Automatically scaling based on load
- **Resource Monitoring** - Understanding application performance metrics
- **Cost Optimization** - Right-sizing resources for efficiency

### Production Readiness
- **Health Probes** - Monitoring application health and enabling self-healing
