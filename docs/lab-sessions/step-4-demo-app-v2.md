    ```

## üìÅ Step 1: Clone the Repository and Set Up Environment

First, we'll clone the demo repository and examine the demo-app-v2 structure.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
# Clone the tech-lab-demos repository
git clone https://github.com/cloud-design-dev/tech-lab-demos.git
cd tech-lab-demos

# Explore the demo-app-v2 directory structure
ls -la demo-app-v2/

# Check the OpenShift manifests
ls -la demo-app-v2/openshift/
```

### 2. Examine the V2 Architecture

```bash
# Review the application structure
cat demo-app-v2/README.md

# Look at the OpenShift deployment files
ls demo-app-v2/openshift/
# You should see:
# - postgresql.yaml (database deployment)
# - app-v2.yaml (application deployment)
```

## üóÑÔ∏è Step 2: Deploy PostgreSQL Database

We'll use the provided PostgreSQL manifest from the repository.

### 1. Deploy PostgreSQL with Persistent Storage

```bash
# Deploy PostgreSQL using the provided manifest
oc apply -f demo-app-v2/openshift/postgresql.yaml

# The manifest includes:
# - PersistentVolumeClaim (postgresql-pvc)
# - Secret (postgresql-secret) 
# - Service (postgresql-service)
# - Deployment (postgresql)
```

### 2. Verify PostgreSQL Deployment

```bash
# Check if PVC was created and bound
oc get pvc postgresql-pvc

# Expected output:
# NAME            STATUS   VOLUME                 CAPACITY   ACCESS MODES
# postgresql-pvc  Bound    pvc-abc123...         10Gi       RWO

# Check PostgreSQL pod status
oc get pods -l app=postgresql

# Wait for PostgreSQL to be ready
oc wait --for=condition=Ready pod -l app=postgresql --timeout=300s
```

### 3. Test Database Connectivity

```bash
# Connect to PostgreSQL and verify it's working
oc exec -it deployment/postgresql -- psql -U demo_user -d demo_db -c "SELECT version();"

# Should show PostgreSQL version information
```

## üöÄ Step 3: Deploy Demo App V2

Now we'll deploy the application using the provided manifest files.

### 1. Deploy Demo App V2 Using Command Line

```bash
# Deploy the application using the provided manifest
oc apply -f demo-app-v2/openshift/app-v2.yaml

# The manifest includes:
# - BuildConfig (builds from GitHub repo)
# - ImageStream (stores built images)
# - Deployment (runs the application)
# - Service (internal networking)
# - Route (external access with HTTPS)
```

### 2. Alternative: Step-by-Step Deployment

If you prefer to understand each component, you can deploy them individually:

```bash
# Create the BuildConfig and ImageStream
oc apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: build.openshift.io/v1
kind: BuildConfig
metadata:
  name: demoapp2
spec:
  source:
    type: Git
    git:
      uri: https://github.com/cloud-design-dev/tech-lab-demos.git
    contextDir: demo-app-v2
  strategy:
    type: Source
    sourceStrategy:
      from:
        kind: ImageStreamTag
        namespace: openshift
        name: python:3.11
  output:
    to:
      kind: ImageStreamTag
      name: demoapp2:latest
---
apiVersion: image.openshift.io/v1
kind: ImageStream
metadata:
  name: demoapp2
EOF

# Start the build
oc start-build demoapp2 --follow
```

### 3. Monitor the Deployment Process

```bash
# Monitor the build process
oc get builds -w

# Watch build logs (in a separate terminal)
oc logs -f bc/demoapp2

# Check build completion
oc get builds -l buildconfig=demoapp2

# Monitor deployment rollout
oc rollout status deployment/demoapp2 --timeout=300s
```

### 4. Verify Application Deployment

```bash
# Check all components are running
oc get pods -l app=demoapp2

# Verify the route was created
oc get route demoapp2

# Test application connectivity
APP_URL=$(oc get route demoapp2 -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')
echo "Demo App V2 URL: https://$APP_URL"

# Test the health endpoint
curl -k https://$APP_URL/api/health
```

## üìä Step 4: Compare V1 vs V2 Behavior

Now you can directly compare the persistence behavior between the two applications.

### 1. Access Both Applications

```bash
# Get both application URLs
echo "V1 (Ephemeral): https://$(oc get route demoapp1 -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')"
echo "V2 (Persistent): https://$(oc get route demoapp2 -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')"
```

### 2. Test Persistence in Both Apps

**In Demo App V1:**
1. Click **"Test Persistence"** to add data
2. Note the entries appear
3. Click **"Reload Page (Demo Reset)"**  
4. ‚ùå Data disappears (ephemeral storage)

**In Demo App V2:**
1. Click **"Test Persistence"** to add data
2. Note the entries appear  
3. Click **"Reload Page"** (no reset - data persists!)
4. ‚úÖ Data remains (persistent storage)

### 3. Test Pod Restart Persistence

```bash
# Restart the V2 application pod
oc delete pod -l app=demoapp2

# Wait for new pod to start
oc wait --for=condition=Ready pod -l app=demoapp2

# Check the V2 app - data should still be there!
# Check the V1 app - data will be gone (if any was added since last restart)
```

## üîç Step 5: Explore Storage Concepts

### 1. Examine Persistent Volume Claims

```bash
# List all PVCs in your project
oc get pvc

# Get detailed information about the PostgreSQL PVC
oc describe pvc postgresql-pvc

# Check storage class details
oc get storageclass ibmc-vpc-block-5iops-tier -o yaml
```

### 2. View Database Data

```bash
# Connect to PostgreSQL and examine the data
oc exec -it deployment/postgresql -- psql -U demo_user -d demo_db

# In the PostgreSQL shell, run:
# \dt                    -- List tables
# SELECT * FROM entries;  -- View stored data
# \q                     -- Quit
```

### 3. Monitor Resource Usage

```bash
# Check storage usage
oc exec -it deployment/postgresql -- df -h /var/lib/postgresql/data

# View pod resource consumption
oc adm top pods -l app=postgresql
oc adm top pods -l app=demoapp2
```

## üìà Step 6: Database Operations

### 1. Scale the Application (Database Persists)

```bash
# Scale Demo App V2 to 3 replicas
oc scale deployment demoapp2 --replicas=3

# Watch the scaling
oc get pods -l app=demoapp2 -w

# Test the application - all pods connect to the same database
# Data is shared across all application instances!
```

### 2. Backup Considerations (Demo Only)

```bash
# Example: Create a database dump (educational purposes)
oc exec -it deployment/postgresql -- pg_dump -U demo_user demo_db > /tmp/backup.sql

# In production, you'd use proper backup tools and PVC snapshots
```

## üéì Key Concepts Demonstrated

### Storage Patterns
- **Ephemeral Storage (V1):** Fast but temporary, lost on restart
- **Persistent Storage (V2):** Survives pod lifecycle, enables stateful apps
- **Shared Storage:** Multiple app instances can share the same database

### OpenShift Storage
- **PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC):** Request for storage resources
- **Storage Classes:** Define types of available storage (performance, features)
- **Volume Mounts:** How containers access persistent storage

### Database Integration
- **Environment Variables:** Secure way to pass connection details
- **Kubernetes Secrets:** Store sensitive data like passwords
- **Service Discovery:** Applications find databases via service names

## ‚úÖ Verification Checklist

You've successfully completed Step 4 when:

- ‚úÖ PostgreSQL is running with persistent storage (PVC bound)
- ‚úÖ Demo App V2 is deployed and connects to the database
- ‚úÖ Data persists through page reloads in V2 (unlike V1)
- ‚úÖ Data survives pod restarts in V2
- ‚úÖ Application shows "Step 4" as highlighted/current
- ‚úÖ You can scale V2 and all instances share the same data

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**PostgreSQL pod won't start**
```bash
# Check events and logs
oc describe pod -l app=postgresql
oc logs deployment/postgresql
```

**App can't connect to database**
```bash
# Verify service connectivity
oc exec -it deployment/demoapp2 -- nslookup postgresql-service

# Check environment variables
oc set env deployment/demoapp2 --list
```

**PVC stuck in Pending**
```bash
# Check storage class availability
oc get storageclass
oc describe pvc postgresql-pvc
```

## üìù What's Next?

The persistent storage you've implemented in Demo App V2 solves the data loss problem from V1, but now we need to address performance and scalability. 

In **Step 5**, you'll deploy Demo App V3 which focuses on:
- üìà **Resource Management** with CPU and memory limits
- ‚ö° **Horizontal Pod Autoscaling** based on load
- üîß **Advanced `oc` commands** for scaling and monitoring
- üìä **Load testing** to trigger scaling events
