## üìÅ Step 1: Examine Demo App V4 Structure

First, let's explore the demo-app-v4 directory and understand the health probe deployment workflow.

### 1. Navigate to Demo App V4

```bash
# Change to the demo-app-v4 directory  
cd tech-lab-demos/demo-app-v4

# Explore the application structure
ls -la

# Check the OpenShift deployment manifests
ls -la openshift/

# Review the README for health probe workflow
cat README.md
```

### 2. Examine the Health Probe Configuration Files

```bash
# Look at the base deployment (without probes)
cat openshift/deployment-no-probes.yaml

# Check the probe configuration files
ls openshift/probes/

# Review each probe type
cat openshift/probes/startup-probe.yaml
cat openshift/probes/liveness-probe.yaml  
cat openshift/probes/readiness-probe.yaml
```

## üöÄ Step 2: Deploy Demo App V4 (Initially Without Probes)

We'll start by deploying V4 without health probes, then add them step by step following the repository workflow.

### 1. Deploy Base Application Without Probes

```bash
# Deploy the BuildConfig and ImageStream
oc apply -f openshift/buildconfig.yaml
oc apply -f openshift/imagestream.yaml

# Start the build
oc start-build demoapp4 --follow

# Deploy without health probes (initial state)
oc apply -f openshift/deployment-no-probes.yaml

# Create Service and Route
oc apply -f openshift/service.yaml
oc apply -f openshift/route.yaml
```

### 2. Monitor Initial Deployment

```bash
# Check build status
oc get builds -l buildconfig=demoapp4

# Monitor deployment rollout
oc rollout status deployment/demoapp4 --timeout=300s

# Verify pods are running
oc get pods -l app=demoapp4
```

## üîç Step 3: Verify Initial Deployment and Probe Status

### 1. Check Application Status

```bash
# Verify deployment
oc get deployment demoapp4
oc get pods -l app=demoapp4

# Get application URL
APP_URL=$(oc get route demoapp4 -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')
echo "Demo App V4 URL: https://$APP_URL"

# Test basic functionality
curl -k https://$APP_URL/api/health
```

### 2. Check Current Probe Configuration

```bash
# Check current deployment configuration (should show NO probes)
oc describe deployment demoapp4 | grep -A 10 -B 10 "Liveness\|Readiness\|Startup"

# This should return empty - no probes configured yet
```

### 3. Access V4 and Notice Missing Probes

Visit the application in your browser and observe:
- **Step 6 is highlighted** but not yet completed
- **Health probe status** shows missing probes
- **Application warns** about missing production health checks

## üè• Step 4: Configure Startup Probe (First Health Check)

Following the repository workflow, we'll add probes in the recommended order: startup, liveness, then readiness.

### 1. Add Startup Probe Using Repository Method

```bash
# Option 1: Apply the startup probe patch file
oc apply -f openshift/probes/startup-probe.yaml

# Option 2: Or apply the patch manually
oc patch deployment demoapp4 --patch-file=openshift/probes/startup-probe.yaml
```

### 2. Alternative: Manual Patch Command

```bash
# Manual patch if you prefer command-line approach
oc patch deployment demoapp4 -p '{
  "spec": {
    "template": {
      "spec": {
        "containers": [
          {
            "name": "demoapp4",
            "startupProbe": {
              "httpGet": {
                "path": "/api/health",
                "port": 8080
              },
              "initialDelaySeconds": 10,
              "periodSeconds": 5,
              "timeoutSeconds": 3,
              "failureThreshold": 6
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}'
```

### 3. Verify Startup Probe

```bash
# Check that startup probe was added
oc describe deployment demoapp4 | grep -A 10 "Startup"

# Wait for rollout to complete
oc rollout status deployment/demoapp4

# Check pod status
oc get pods -l app=demoapp4
```

### 4. Test Startup Probe in Application

Refresh the application in your browser and notice:
- **Startup probe status** now shows ‚úÖ Configured
- **Application detects** the startup probe automatically

## üíì Step 5: Configure Liveness Probe (Container Health)

Liveness probes restart containers that become unhealthy.

### 1. Add Liveness Probe Using Repository Method

```bash
# Apply the liveness probe patch file
oc apply -f openshift/probes/liveness-probe.yaml

# Alternative manual patch
oc patch deployment demoapp4 -p '{
  "spec": {
    "template": {
      "spec": {
        "containers": [
          {
            "name": "demoapp4",
            "livenessProbe": {
              "httpGet": {
                "path": "/api/health",
                "port": 8080
              },
              "initialDelaySeconds": 60,
              "periodSeconds": 10,
              "timeoutSeconds": 5,
              "failureThreshold": 3
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}'
```

### 2. Verify Liveness Probe

```bash
# Check liveness probe configuration
oc describe deployment demoapp4 | grep -A 10 "Liveness"

# Wait for rollout
oc rollout status deployment/demoapp4

# Check pod status
oc get pods -l app=demoapp4 -o wide
```

### 3. Test Liveness Probe in Application

Refresh the application and observe:
- **Liveness probe status** now shows ‚úÖ Configured
- **Two of three probes** are now configured

## ‚úÖ Step 6: Configure Readiness Probe (Traffic Readiness)

Readiness probes determine when containers are ready to accept traffic.

### 1. Add Readiness Probe (Final Health Check)

```bash
# Apply the readiness probe patch file
oc apply -f openshift/probes/readiness-probe.yaml

# Alternative manual patch
oc patch deployment demoapp4 -p '{
  "spec": {
    "template": {
      "spec": {
        "containers": [
          {
            "name": "demoapp4",
            "readinessProbe": {
              "httpGet": {
                "path": "/api/health",
                "port": 8080
              },
              "initialDelaySeconds": 10,
              "periodSeconds": 5,
              "timeoutSeconds": 3,
              "failureThreshold": 3
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}'
```

### 2. Verify All Three Probes

```bash
# Check all three probes are configured
oc describe deployment demoapp4 | grep -A 15 "Liveness\|Readiness\|Startup"

# Wait for final rollout
oc rollout status deployment/demoapp4

# Check pod status
oc get pods -l app=demoapp4 -o jsonpath='{.items[*].status.containerStatuses[*].ready}'
```

### 3. Verify Step 6 Completion

Refresh the application and observe:
- **All three probes** now show ‚úÖ Configured
- **Step 6 should automatically complete** with ‚úÖ
- **Congratulations message** appears for completing the lab

## üß™ Step 6: Test Health Probe Behaviors

### 1. Test Readiness Probe Failure

```bash
# Create a temporary endpoint failure to test readiness probe
curl -k -X POST https://$APP_URL/api/health/toggle-readiness

# Watch the pod get removed from service
watch -n 2 'oc get endpoints demoapp4-service'

# After ~15 seconds, restore readiness
curl -k -X POST https://$APP_URL/api/health/toggle-readiness

# Pod should be added back to service
```

### 2. Test Liveness Probe Failure

```bash
# Simulate a liveness failure (this will restart the container)
curl -k -X POST https://$APP_URL/api/health/toggle-liveness

# Watch the container get restarted
watch -n 2 'oc get pods -l app=demoapp4 -o wide'

# Check restart count
oc describe pod -l app=demoapp4 | grep "Restart Count"
```

### 3. Monitor Health Check Events

```bash
# View events related to health check failures
oc get events --field-selector involvedObject.name=$(oc get pod -l app=demoapp4 -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}') --sort-by=.metadata.creationTimestamp

# View container logs during health failures
oc logs -l app=demoapp4 --tail=50
```

## üîß Step 7: Advanced Health Monitoring

### 1. Custom Health Endpoints

Demo App V4 provides several health-related endpoints:

```bash
# Check detailed health status
curl -k https://$APP_URL/api/health/detailed

# Get probe configuration status
curl -k https://$APP_URL/api/health/probes

# Test database connectivity health
curl -k https://$APP_URL/api/health/database
```

### 2. Health Check Configuration Analysis

```bash
# Export current probe configuration for review
oc get deployment demoapp4 -o yaml | grep -A 20 "livenessProbe\|readinessProbe\|startupProbe"

# Compare with production best practices
cat <<EOF

Production Health Probe Recommendations:
==========================================
Liveness Probe:
  - initialDelaySeconds: 30-60 (depending on startup time)
  - periodSeconds: 10-30 (not too frequent)
  - timeoutSeconds: 5-10
  - failureThreshold: 3-5 (allows for temporary issues)

Readiness Probe:
  - initialDelaySeconds: 5-15 (faster than liveness)
  - periodSeconds: 5-10 (more frequent for traffic routing)
  - timeoutSeconds: 2-5 (quick response needed)
  - failureThreshold: 2-3 (removes from service quickly)

Startup Probe:
  - initialDelaySeconds: 10-30
  - periodSeconds: 2-5 (frequent during startup)
  - failureThreshold: 20-60 (allows for slow startup)
  - Use for applications with long initialization

EOF
```

## üìä Step 8: Production Health Monitoring

### 1. Scaling with Health Probes

```bash
# Scale to 3 replicas to see health probes in action
oc scale deployment demoapp4 --replicas=3

# Watch all pods become ready with health checks
watch -n 2 'oc get pods -l app=demoapp4 -o wide'

# Verify all pods are in service
oc get endpoints demoapp4-service -o yaml | grep -A 20 "addresses"
```

### 2. Rolling Updates with Health Checks

```bash
# Trigger a rolling update to see health probes during deployment
oc patch deployment demoapp4 -p '{"spec":{"template":{"metadata":{"annotations":{"deployment.kubernetes.io/revision":"rolling-update-test"}}}}}'

# Watch the rolling update with health checks
oc rollout status deployment/demoapp4

# Verify zero-downtime deployment
while true; do curl -k -s https://$APP_URL/api/health | grep -o "healthy" || echo "FAILED"; sleep 1; done
```

## ‚úÖ Step 9: Verify Complete Lab Progression

### 1. Check All Applications

```bash
# List all demo applications
oc get deployments -l 'app in (demoapp1,demoapp2,demoapp3,demoapp4)'

# List all routes
oc get routes -l 'app in (demoapp1,demoapp2,demoapp3,demoapp4)'

# Check resource usage across all apps
oc adm top pods -l 'app in (demoapp1,demoapp2,demoapp3,demoapp4,postgresql)'
```

### 2. Verify Lab Progression

Visit all four applications:

| App | URL | Step Status | Key Feature |
|-----|-----|-------------|-------------|
| V1 | `https://$(oc get route demoapp1 -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')` | Step 3 ‚úÖ | Ephemeral Storage |
| V2 | `https://$(oc get route demoapp2 -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')` | Step 4 ‚úÖ | Persistent Storage |
| V3 | `https://$(oc get route demoapp3 -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')` | Step 5 ‚úÖ | Auto-Scaling |
| V4 | `https://$(oc get route demoapp4 -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')` | Step 6 ‚úÖ | Health Probes |

### 3. Final Architecture Overview
