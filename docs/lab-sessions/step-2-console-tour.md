# Step 2: OpenShift Console Tour

Now that your ROKS cluster is running, it's time to explore the OpenShift web console and understand the different views and capabilities available to you.

!!! info "Estimated Time"
    **Exploration Time:** 20-25 minutes

## üéØ Learning Objectives

By the end of this step, you will:

- **Machine Sets** - Node scaling configuration
- **Machine Config** - Node configuration management

!!! tip "Administrator vs Developer"
    Administrator view is for cluster-wide operations and infrastructure management. Developer view focuses on application development and deployment.

## üë®‚Äçüíª Developer View Exploration

Switch to Developer view using the perspective switcher in the top-left corner.

### Developer Console Features

The Developer view is designed for application developers and includes:

#### 1. Project Selection
- **Current project** displayed prominently
- **Project switcher** for navigating between namespaces
- **Create project** option

#### 2. Main Navigation

**+Add**
: Deploy new applications and services

**Topology**
: Visual representation of your applications

**Project**
: Project-specific resources and settings

**Builds**
: Source-to-Image builds and build configurations

**Pipelines**
: CI/CD pipeline management

**Helm**
: Helm chart deployment and management

## üìÅ Creating Your First Project

A project in OpenShift is equivalent to a Kubernetes namespace with additional security and resource management features.

### 1. Create a New Project

1. In Developer view, click **"Create a project"** 
2. **Project Details:**
   - **Name:** `[group-letter]-project` 
     - Example: `a-project` for Group A
     - Example: `m-project` for Group M
   - **Display Name:** `Group [Letter] Demo Project`
   - **Description:** `OpenShift demo lab project for Group [Letter]`

3. Click **"Create"**

### 2. Verify Project Creation

- Your new project should appear in the project selector
- The topology view should be empty (no applications yet)
- Project details should show in the Project tab

## üõ†Ô∏è Exploring Deployment Options

With your project created, explore the available deployment options.

### 1. Access the +Add Page

Click **"+Add"** in the Developer navigation to see deployment options:

#### Developer Catalog
- **Samples** - Pre-built example applications
- **Services** - Databases and middleware
- **Operators** - Advanced service management

#### Import Options
- **Import from Git** - Deploy from source code repositories
- **Container Images** - Deploy from existing container images
- **YAML** - Deploy from Kubernetes manifests

#### Advanced Options
- **Operator Backed** - Deploy via OpenShift operators
- **Helm Charts** - Package manager for Kubernetes
- **Event Source** - Serverless event-driven applications

### 2. Explore Sample Applications

1. Click **"Samples"** to see available templates
2. Browse options like:
   - Node.js applications
   - Python Django/Flask apps
   - Java Spring Boot applications
   - Database templates

### 3. Check Available Container Images

1. Click **"Container Images"** 
2. Note that you can deploy from:
   - Public registries (Docker Hub, Quay.io)
   - Private registries
   - OpenShift internal registry

## üîç Understanding the Interface

### Topology View Concepts

The Topology view will become your primary interface for managing applications:

- **Nodes** represent applications or services
- **Connectors** show relationships between components
- **Status indicators** show health and deployment status
- **Groupings** organize related resources

### Resource Management

OpenShift provides several ways to manage resources:
- **Console forms** - User-friendly web interfaces
- **YAML editor** - Direct Kubernetes resource editing
- **Command line** - Via `oc` CLI tool

## üéì Key Concepts Learned

### OpenShift Architecture
- **Projects/Namespaces** provide isolation and resource management
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** controls who can access what
- **Routes vs Services** - External vs internal network access

### Console Navigation
- **Administrator view** - Cluster-wide operations and monitoring
- **Developer view** - Application-focused development workflow
- **Context switching** between different operational perspectives

### Deployment Patterns
- **Source-to-Image (S2I)** - Build from source code
- **Container deployment** - Deploy existing images
- **Template-based** - Repeatable deployment patterns

## ‚úÖ Verification Checklist

You've successfully completed Step 2 when:

- ‚úÖ You can navigate between Administrator and Developer views
- ‚úÖ You've explored the main sections of both console views
- ‚úÖ You've created a project with your group naming convention
- ‚úÖ You've reviewed available deployment options in +Add
- ‚úÖ You understand the different ways to deploy applications

## üîç Optional Exploration

If you have extra time, explore these additional features:

### Administrator View Deep Dive
- Check **Node** information in Compute section
- Review **Storage Classes** available
- Look at **Events** to see cluster activity

### Developer View Features
- Explore **Helm** charts available
- Check **Builds** section (currently empty)
- Review **Project** settings and resource quotas
