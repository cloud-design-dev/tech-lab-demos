    # Behavior Facts
    {
        "fact": "Cats spend 70% of their lives sleeping, which equals 13-16 hours a day. This helps them conserve energy for hunting, even though domestic cats don't need to hunt for survival.",
        "query": "behavior",
        "category": "behavior"
    },
    {
        "fact": "When cats purr, it's not just a sign of contentment. Purring frequencies between 20-50 Hz can promote bone healing and reduce pain and swelling in cats.",
        "query": "behavior",
        "category": "behavior"
    },
    {
        "fact": "Cats have a third eyelid called a nictitating membrane that helps protect their eyes during fights or while hunting through tall grass.",
        "query": "behavior",
        "category": "anatomy"
    },
    {
        "fact": "A cat's tail is an extension of their spine and contains 19-23 vertebrae. Cats use their tails for balance and communication, with different positions indicating different moods.",

        "category": "anatomy"
    },

        "category": "anatomy"
    },
    
    # Hunting & Senses
    {
        "fact": "Cats have excellent night vision and can see in light levels six times lower than what humans need. Their eyes reflect light, which is why they appear to glow in the dark.",
        "query": "hunting",
        "category": "senses"
    },
    {
        "fact": "A cat's whiskers are roughly as wide as their body, helping them determine if they can fit through tight spaces. Whiskers also detect air currents and vibrations.",
        "query": "hunting",
        "category": "senses"
    },
    {
        "fact": "Cats can hear frequencies up to 64,000 Hz (humans can only hear up to 20,000 Hz), which helps them detect the high-pitched sounds made by small prey like mice.",
        "query": "hunting",
        "category": "senses"
    },
    {
        "fact": "Cats have a success rate of only 10% when hunting birds, but up to 60% when hunting small mammals like mice and voles.",

    },
    
    # Communication
    {

        "category": "communication"
    },
    {
        "fact": "Cats have over 100 different vocal sounds, while dogs only have about 10. Each cat develops a unique 'vocabulary' to communicate with their human family.",

        "category": "communication"
    },
    {
        "fact": "When cats slowly blink at you, it's called a 'cat kiss' and indicates trust and affection. You can return the gesture by slowly blinking back at them.",

        "category": "communication"
    },
    {
        "fact": "Cats mark their territory through scent glands located in their cheeks, forehead, paws, and tail base. When they rub against you, they're marking you as 'theirs.'",

        "category": "abilities"
    },

        "category": "abilities"
    },
    {
        "fact": "A cat's flexible spine has 30 vertebrae (humans have 24), giving them incredible flexibility and allowing them to squeeze through any opening larger than their skull.",
        "query": "physical",
        "category": "anatomy"
    },
    {
        "fact": "Cats walk like camels and giraffes - they move both right feet first, then both left feet. This gait helps them move silently when stalking prey.",
