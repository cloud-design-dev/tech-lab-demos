### Updated Development Tasks
```bash
# V1 Demo App
mise run v1-install        # Install dependencies  
mise run v1-dev            # Run local development server
mise run v1-docker-run     # Run with resource limits (256m RAM, 0.5 CPU)

# V2 Demo App  
mise run v2-install        # Install dependencies
mise run v2-dev            # Run local development server
mise run v2-docker-run     # Run with SQLite database

# Check-in App
mise run checkin-install   # Install in virtual environment
mise run checkin-dev       # Run development server

# Utilities
mise run install-all       # Install all dependencies
mise run clean-docker      # Stop all containers
```

### Enhanced Persistence API Response
The `/api/persistence/stats` endpoint now provides complete ephemeral storage information:
```json
{
  "total_entries": 0,
  "storage_type": "in-memory", 
  "persistence_level": "ephemeral",
  "data_survives_restart": false,
  "data_survives_page_reload": false,
  "entries": [],
  "warning": "Data will be lost when container restarts or page reloads",
  "last_data_reset": "2025-08-13T17:27:31.148477",
  "last_main_page_access": "2025-08-13T17:27:31.148491",
  "last_updated": "2025-08-13T17:27:35.123456"
}
```

### Perfect V1 vs V2 Demonstration
The V1 application now provides the ideal contrast to V2:

**V1 Behavior (Ephemeral)**:
1. User adds test data → entries appear in API stats
2. User clicks "Reload Page" → main page reloads  
3. All persistence data is lost → API stats show empty entries
4. Perfect demonstration of ephemeral storage limitations

**V2 Behavior (Persistent)**:
1. User adds test data → entries saved to PostgreSQL
2. User reloads page → data persists in database
3. API stats continue showing all entries
4. Perfect demonstration of persistent storage benefits

This final implementation creates the perfect educational tool for demonstrating container storage concepts, with V1 showing true ephemeral behavior and V2 demonstrating persistent database storage.
